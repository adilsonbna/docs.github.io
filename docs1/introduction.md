## Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Heat Water:** Bring your water to a boil and let it cool for about 30-60 seconds. The ideal temperature is between **90-96°C** (195-205°F).
2.  **Grind Beans:** While the water is heating, weigh and grind your coffee beans to a medium-fine consistency, similar to table salt.
3.  **Prepare Filter:** Place the paper filter in the dripper and set it on top of your mug or carafe. Pour some hot water through the filter to rinse it and preheat the vessel. Discard the rinse water.
4.  **Brew the Coffee:** Add your ground coffee to the filter and gently shake to level the bed. Place the entire setup on your scale and tare it to zero. Start a timer and pour about 50g of water evenly over the grounds. Let it "bloom" for 30 seconds.
    
5.  **Continue Pouring:** Slowly pour the remaining water in concentric circles, trying to maintain a consistent water level. Aim to finish your pour by the **2:30** mark.
6.  **Enjoy:** Once the water has dripped through, remove the dripper and enjoy your coffee!

> **Pro Tip:** The freshness of your beans is the single most important factor for a great cup of coffee. Try to use beans that were roasted within the last few weeks.
