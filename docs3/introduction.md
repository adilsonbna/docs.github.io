If you're in the world of software development, you've almost certainly heard of Git. But what is it, and why is it so important? This guide will walk you through the absolute basics to get you started on your version control journey.

## What is Git?

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**. In simple terms, it's a tool that helps you track changes in your files. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.

## Prerequisites

* A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
* Access to the command line/terminal.
* A desire to learn!

## Step 1: Installation & Configuration

First, you need to install Git.

* **macOS:** If you have Homebrew, you can run `brew install git`. Alternatively, installing Xcode Command Line Tools will install Git.
* **Windows:** Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
* **Linux:** You can use your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    ```

After installation, configure your name and email. This is important because every Git commit uses this information.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
